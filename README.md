# My Notes on Docker

This is just a repo that contains my notes on learning Docker taken mostly from the learning path [Containers](https://learn.acloud.guru/learning-path/cloud-adjacent-containers) from a cloud guru, but as well as other resources on the internet.
* 

This is for my personal use and learning, so this should not be taken as an official guide for learning Docker, in this case please refer to the official documentation [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).

Hope you enjoy it and I am open for any update or fix you might believe necessary.

\~ Pura Vida!
